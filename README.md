My first repository on GitHub which was on the coupon dataset. 
Compared to customers who did not take coupons, those who did likely to have distinct present time patterns.
Most consumers took advantage of the vouchers, and many of them preferred cheaper venues and coffee shops.
It could need further research to pinpoint the precise characteristics affecting coupon acceptability.
The analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior regarding coupon acceptance in driving scenarios. Further exploration and feature engineering can enhance our understanding of the factors influencing customer decisions.
